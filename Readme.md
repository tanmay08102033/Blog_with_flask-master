### Blog using flask
The blog is created using flask as backend. I have used bootstrap for the frontend part. For storing the data, I have made use of MySQL database. I have used the python SQL toolkit SQLAlchemy for performing database access.

Also, I have deployed the app with the help of heroku platform. For serving the database purpose in heroku platform, I have used database SQL service Postgres SQL.



### To Run app locally
python blog.py

> To tweak parameters, update config.json file.
